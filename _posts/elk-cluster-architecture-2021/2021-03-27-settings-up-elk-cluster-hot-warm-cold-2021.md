This is my first blog post and I decided to write a series of article because it's a big subject.

The Elastic Stack is pretty well developed and the documentation is quite clear. Owever, I encoutered some problems that are not explained in the documention. It took me some times to resolve them and this is why I decided to share these informations.

On this page, you will find the link of the different articles.
